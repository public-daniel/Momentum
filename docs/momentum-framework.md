# Momentum

*Momentum is a framework for personal productivity and continuous improvement, designed to help you understand yourself, define your direction, and align your daily actions with your long-term vision through a cyclical process of planning, action, and reflection.*

## Understand Yourself: Who Are You?

* **Purpose:** Gain deep self-awareness about your current state, tendencies, energy patterns, work patterns, non-negotiables, and **latent interests** as the foundation for intentional action and exploration.
* **Activities:** Reflect on past actions, habits (effective & ineffective), personality traits, strengths, weaknesses. Track current energy and focus levels. Journaling prompts: *Who am I right now? What do my typical days/weeks reveal about my actual priorities? What activities drain my energy vs. energize me? What are my typical work rhythms and focus patterns? What are my common distractions or procrastination triggers? What feedback have I received? What are my biggest fears or anxieties impacting action? **What topics or activities spark genuine curiosity, even if passively?*** Consider "negative visions" or anti-goals: *What life/outcomes do I absolutely want to avoid? What's the likely trajectory if I change nothing?* **Acknowledge and capture serendipitous insights or discoveries.**
* **Integration:** Assess current relationship with tools (technology, information) – are they serving core needs effectively? Baseline understanding of current work capacity and focus.
* **Output:** Honest self-assessment, list of potential friction points (internal & external), identified **areas of interest/curiosity** (active or latent), awareness of current energy and work patterns.

## North Star: Who Do You Want to be?

* **Purpose:** Create a positive, motivating vision for who you want to become and how you want to live, identifying what truly matters most to guide your choices and provide direction amidst flexibility.
* **Activities:** Define core values and guiding principles. Visualize your ideal future across key life domains (Career; Finances & Wealth; Relationships (Family, Friends, Partner); Personal Attributes & Character; Learning & Personal Growth; Health & Wellbeing; Leisure, Hobbies, & Fun; Contribution, Impact, Community, & Legacy; Spirituality & Meaning; etc.). Describe your ideal rhythms and schedule. Translate the vision into actionable guiding principles for decision-making. What are the core factors essential for success and happiness in my life? How do I want to feel? Where should I be investing my finite time, energy, and focus?
* **Integration:** This clarifies priorities, enabling more effective goal setting, helping evaluate commitments, tools, habits, and experiments based on alignment with your vision and values. It helps identify potential **Wildly Important Goals (WIGs)** – those few critical goals with the highest potential impact.
* **Output:** A set of guiding principles, core values, a vision for different life areas, and identified core factors crucial for your well-being and success.

## Habits & Routines

* **Purpose:** Build consistent, automatic behaviours that support well-being, reduce decision fatigue, manage energy, and support effective work. Tracked regularly within the operating rhythm.
* **Characteristics:** Intended for long-term consistency, often process-oriented in service of a desired state. Requires upfront effort, then relies on regularity. Habits often emerge from successful Experiments (Pacts) that prove valuable enough to persist long-term.
* **Examples:** Consistent sleep/wake cycles, regular movement/exercise, hydration, mindfulness/reflection practices, structured start-up and shut-down routines for the workday, pre-defined blocks for working on priorities (often identified via Time Blocking), routines for managing communication influx, planned disconnection/digital hygiene practices, intentional engagement in restorative leisure activities.
* **Tracking:** Tracked via simple checklists or habit trackers, typically reviewed daily and weekly, often visualized on a Scoreboard.

## Goals & Outcomes

* **Purpose:** Achieve specific, measurable results or milestones (Lag Measures) that align with your North Star, often requiring significant focused effort. Progress is reviewed within the operating rhythm.
* **Focus on the Wildly Important:** To maximize impact, apply the discipline of selecting a very small number (typically 1-3) of **Wildly Important Goals (WIGs)** from your potential objectives. These are the critical strategic goals, derived from your North Star, that require disproportionate focus and energy.
* **Define and Track Lead Measures:** For each Goal, especially WIGs, identify the crucial, influenceable **Lead Measures** – the *input* activities you directly control that have the highest predictive power for achieving the goal. For knowledge work WIGs, a primary Lead Measure is often **Time Spent in Deep/Focused Work** dedicated specifically to that WIG. Consistently track your performance on these Lead Measures.
* **Characteristics:** Outcome-oriented (Lag Measures), often time-bound. Driven by performance on associated Lead Measures.
* **Integration:** WIGs provide purpose for focused work. Lead Measures translate goals into controllable daily/weekly actions. Tracking Lead Measures provides real-time feedback on the efforts most likely to drive results. ***While Goals/WIGs focus on achieving a specific outcome (Lag Measure), success also involves learning and adapting the approach (Lead Measures) based on performance data and reflection within the Operating Rhythm.***
* **Examples:** Launch a specific service by Q3 (WIG). *Lead Measure:* Hours/week focused development/marketing logged. Achieve fitness target (Goal). *Lead Measure:* Workouts completed/week. Complete a professional certification (Goal). *Lead Measure:* Study hours logged.

### Milestones

* Break WIGs/Goals into projects, tasks, and milestones, *particularly for complex Achievement Goals*. Managed via appropriate tools (task lists, project managers). Requires planning to allocate sufficient time and energy, guided by Lead Measure targets. *(Slight softening of applicability)*

## Experiments & Exploration (Pact-Driven Learning)

* **Purpose:** Intentionally test assumptions, explore curiosities (**Interests**), learn new skills, or find better ways of working through defined, time-bound actions (**Pacts**). The primary focus is on the **process of execution and the emergent learning**, rather than achieving a specific, pre-defined outcome beyond gaining insight. These Pacts are managed and reviewed within the **Operating Rhythm**.
* **Initiation:** Pacts often arise from: Curiosity sparked by the **North Star** or **Self-Understanding** (including identified **Interests**), Problem-Solving needs revealed during **Review** cycles (e.g., "How can I improve focus?"), Skill Gaps identified for a **Goal**, testing potential **Habits & Routines**, or following up on **serendipitous discoveries**.
* **Integration & Examples:** Use Pacts to test specific strategies or answer defined questions in a low-stakes way:
  * Test scheduling communication blocks for 2 weeks (*Hypothesis: Reduces context switching*).
  * Attempt a 30-day pause on [distracting activity] (*Question: How does this impact focus/mood?*).
  * Practice [specific technique] for 15 mins daily for 3 weeks (*Aim: Initial skill exploration for potential future Goal*).
  * Experiment with a new work session structure for one month (*Hypothesis: Time blocking increases task completion*).
* **Structured Pact Definition:**
  * Define the experiment clearly using a Pact format: `I will explore [Hypothesis/Question/Interest Area] by doing [Specific, Repeatable Action] with [Frequency] for [Specific Duration/Repetitions].`
  * Link the Pact to its originating goal, problem, interest area, or curiosity for context.
  * State the central **Hypothesis or Question** guiding the experiment. This provides a *focus for observation*, not a rigid success criterion.
  * Set clear start and end dates or number of repetitions.
* **Execution & Data Capture:**
  * **Adherence Tracking:** Simple log to track completion of the committed Pact action (Yes/No daily/weekly). Streaks optional. ***The primary measure of success for a Pact is adherence to the planned action for its duration and subsequent reflection.***
  * **Contextual Notes/Logs:** Capture relevant qualitative notes *during* the Pact – observations related to the hypothesis/question, feelings experienced, insights gained, challenges encountered, unexpected results, or new directions suggested by the process. Keep capture lightweight.
  * **(Optional) Quantitative Data:** If relevant, track specific metrics, but treat this as **data points for reflection**, not pass/fail criteria.
  * ***Distinction:*** This tracking serves the learning goal of the Pact itself and differs from the rigorous **Lead Measure** tracking focused on driving a specific **Goal/WIG** outcome.
* **Review & Outcome (Based on Steering Sheet):**
  * At the end of the Pact's duration, use structured reflection tools (specifically the **Steering Sheet** framework) informed by captured adherence, notes, and data.
  * Analyze **External Signals** (circumstances, practicalities) and **Internal Signals** (feelings, learning, motivation) related to the Pact's experience and effects.
  * Explicitly decide the next step:
    * **Persist:** Continue the action, possibly converting it into a **Habit/Routine** or extending the Pact.
    * **Pause:** Stop the action for now, documenting the learning.
    * **Pivot:** Modify the action, frequency, duration, or hypothesis based on learnings, potentially defining a new, related Pact.
  * Document the decision and key rationale. ***Unexpected results or "failed" hypotheses are valuable learning outcomes.***

## Operating Rhythm: Planning & Review Cycles

This is the core engine of Momentum, translating insight and intention into action and learning. It follows a simple but powerful cyclical pattern across multiple time horizons: **Plan/Set Intentions -> Act & Track -> Review & Reflect.** This rhythm helps ensure your daily actions are aligned with your North Star and Goals (especially WIGs), informed by ongoing learning from Habits and **Experiments (Pacts)**, and driven by performance on **Lead Measures**. It functions as your **Cadence of Accountability**, using visualized data (**Scoreboards**) for feedback. Remember this structure provides a template; **adapt it with flexibility** based on your needs and life's demands. ***Consider consciously applying Intentional Imperfection during planning – where will 'good enough' suffice to enable excellence elsewhere?***

### Daily Cycle

* **Plan (Morning):** Briefly review North Star/Priority Goals (**WIGs**)/Active **Pacts (Experiments)**. Set 1-3 key priorities for the day. **Schedule the day using Time Blocking:** Proactively assign specific purposes/tasks (including **Lead Measure actions for WIGs**, **Pact actions**, Habits, necessary shallow work, communication, and breaks) to blocks of time. **Revise the schedule dynamically** throughout the day as needed – the value is in ongoing intentionality.
* **Act & Track:** Execute the plan. Track adherence to Habits and **Pact** actions. **Track performance on key Lead Measures.** Capture brief notes or logs as needed (especially for Pacts). This data feeds your **Scoreboard**.
* **Review (Evening):** Briefly reflect on the day. What went well? What were the challenges? Note any key insights or adjustments needed for tomorrow. Update habit/**Pact**/ **Lead Measure** tracking if not done already.

### Weekly Cycle

* **Review (End of Week/Start of Next): This is your primary Cadence of Accountability.**
  * **Review Inputs:** Habit tracker data, Goal/WIG progress (tasks done, outcome trends), **Lead Measure performance (via a Scoreboard)**, **Pact (Experiment) logs (adherence, notes, data related to hypothesis)**, daily notes/reflections, PMN from last week.
  * **Reflection:** Conduct current week's PMN (holistic view). **Analyze the Scoreboard:** Confront performance on **Lead Measures** against targets and assess correlation with **WIG** progress. Why were targets hit/missed? Assess effectiveness of Habits/Routines. Evaluate overall time allocation and effectiveness of **Time Blocking**: Did it reflect North Star/WIG priorities? ***Were Pacts (Experiments) completed as planned? What insights or surprises emerged from them?*** Any procrastination patterns? (Triple Check). Pacts ending? (Steering Sheet analysis needed). What were the key accomplishments and lessons learned (from both Goals and Pacts)? ***Where did I practice Intentional Imperfection effectively or ineffectively?***
* **Plan (Start of Week):** Based on the review, set priorities and focus areas (especially WIGs) for the upcoming week. **Schedule blocks for priority work (Lead Measures)**, ongoing **Pact** actions, new/pivoted **Pact** actions, and Habit focus using **Time Blocking**. Adjust scheduling approach based on reflection. Commit to actions for the upcoming week based on the review.

### Monthly Cycle

* **Review:**
  * **Review Inputs:** Weekly PMN trends, Goal/milestone achievement, **trends in Lead Measures (Scoreboard summaries)**, completed **Pact (Experiment)** outcomes (Steering Sheet summaries).
  * **Reflection:** Higher-level assessment. Are **WIGs**/priority goals on track? Is progress correlated with effort on **Lead Measures**? What system adjustments (Habits, Routines, Tools, **Pacts**, Time Blocking strategies) have been most impactful? Revisit **tool choices based on effectiveness and alignment with core factors/values**. ***Review overall balance between goal-driven work and exploration (Pacts).*** What worked well this month? What needs adjustment?
* **Plan:** Adjust Goals/WIGs/milestones. Identify needs for *new* **Pacts (Experiments)** based on blockages, curiosities, or **Interests**. Recommit to key Habits. Set broad priorities or focus areas (WIGs) for the next month.

### Quarterly Cycle

* **Review:**
  * **Review Inputs:** Monthly review summaries, major Goal/ **WIG** /milestone progress, significant **Pact (Experiment)** learnings.
  * **Reflection:** Assess progress towards broader objectives and **WIGs** set at the start of the quarter. Evaluate the effectiveness of the overall system (Habits, routines, planning/review cadence, **Lead Measure tracking**, **Pact effectiveness for learning**, Time Blocking). Are the chosen strategies working? Is the direction still aligned with the North Star?
* **Plan:** Set/adjust broad objectives and **WIGs** for the next quarter. Identify major areas for Habit focus or **Experimentation (Pacts)**. Refine system components as needed.

### Annual Cycle

* **Review:**
  * **Review Inputs:** Quarterly review summaries, major Goal/ **WIG** achievements/misses, significant **Pact (Experiment)** learnings over the year, overall system effectiveness. Revisit "Understand Yourself" & "North Star".
  * **Reflection:** Deep reflection on alignment with North Star/Values. How has progress been on long-term **WIGs**? What major shifts occurred (potentially driven by **Pacts**)? What worked systemically? What didn't? How has personal capacity and effectiveness evolved? Conduct a comprehensive year-in-review.
* **Plan:** Reset/adjust North Star if needed. Define high-level Goals and **WIGs** and vision for the upcoming year. Identify major areas for Habit focus or **Experimentation (Pacts)**. Set the stage for the next cycle of quarterly, monthly, weekly, and daily rhythms.

## Accountability

* **Purpose:** Increase follow-through on commitments (Habits, **Pacts (Experiments)**, **Lead Measures for WIGs**), gain external perspective, celebrate progress, troubleshoot challenges, leveraging the outputs of the Planning & Review Cycles (**Cadence of Accountability**). It's important to track both your actions (**Lead Measures**, Pact adherence) and your learnings... not just "did you do it", but also "***what did you learn from doing/not doing it? What was surprising?***" (especially crucial for Pacts).
* **Methods:**
  * **Self-Accountability:** Utilize the structured review process (**Cadence of Accountability**) itself, confronting **Scoreboard** data and **Pact** reflections. Implement commitment devices where helpful.
  * **Partners/Groups:** Share relevant parts of weekly/monthly/quarterly review summaries (e.g., PMN, **WIG** updates, **Scoreboard data**, **Experiment (Pact)** outcomes/learnings/surprises). Discuss challenges and strategies.
  * **Public Learning (Optional):** Share aspects of your process/learnings/**Scoreboard**/ **Pact insights** as appropriate (learning in public).
  * **Visibility Tools:** Use shared tools for relevant Goals/WIGs/Experiments if collaborating. The tool implementing Momentum should provide **Scoreboard** views and potentially Pact summaries.
  * **(Potential) LLM Integration:** Assist in summarizing review data, analyzing **Scoreboard** trends, highlighting **Pact** insights, prompting reflection questions, drafting accountability updates (use thoughtfully).

### Techniques & Ideas

#### 1. Plus Minus Next (PMN)

* **Purpose:** A simple metacognitive tool for **structured reflection** used to create **growth loops**. It facilitates learning from experience by systematically reviewing a defined period (e.g., a week, the duration of an experiment).
* **Mechanism:** Involves three columns or sections:
  * **Plus (+):** Document what went well, successes, achievements, positive feelings, moments of joy, things you're grateful for during the period.
  * **Minus (-):** Document challenges, obstacles, mistakes, things that didn't go as planned, negative feelings, frustrations, areas needing attention.
  * **Next (->):** Based on the insights from Plus and Minus, define **actionable steps** or intentions for the *next* period. This focuses on incremental adjustments and continuous improvement.
* **Use Case:** Typically used for weekly reviews, end-of-experiment analysis, or even team retrospectives to ensure consistent learning and adaptation.

#### 2. Triple Check

* **Purpose:** A diagnostic tool specifically designed to understand the **underlying reasons for procrastination** on a particular task or commitment, moving beyond simple self-blame ("I'm lazy") to identify actionable root causes.
* **Mechanism:** Involves asking three distinct questions related to different aspects of motivation and capability:
  * **Head (Rational):** "Is the task appropriate?" (Does it make sense strategically? Does it align with goals? Is the approach sound?) Addresses skepticism about the task's value or method.
  * **Heart (Emotional/Affective):** "Is the task exciting?" (Does it feel engaging, interesting, or meaningful? Or is there underlying fear, boredom, anxiety, or resentment?) Addresses emotional resistance or lack of intrinsic motivation.
  * **Hand (Practical/Perceived Ability):** "Is the task doable?" (Do I believe I have the necessary skills, resources, time, or energy to actually perform the action?) Addresses perceived lack of competence or feasibility.
* **Use Case:** Employed when you notice you are avoiding or delaying a specific action or experiment, to pinpoint the specific friction point and determine the appropriate solution (e.g., redefine strategy [Head], redesign the experience [Heart], request support/training [Hand]).

#### 3. Steering Sheet

* **Purpose:** A decision-making framework used at **key crossroads** (especially after completing an experiment/Pact cycle) to make a more informed and holistic choice about the next direction: **Persist, Pause, or Pivot**. It aims to broaden the decision frame beyond simple gut feelings or narrow pros/cons lists.
* **Mechanism:** Involves systematically considering and listing two types of factors influencing the decision:
  * **External Signals:** Objective facts, circumstances, practical limitations, resource availability, feedback received, changes in the environment, alignment with other commitments.
  * **Internal Signals:** Subjective feelings, emotions, motivation levels, energy levels, self-confidence, sense of alignment with values, gut instincts, level of enjoyment or fulfillment derived from the activity.
* **Use Case:** Applied when evaluating the results and experience of an experiment or significant phase of work to consciously decide the next step, ensuring both practical realities and personal feelings are weighed appropriately.
