Description=Momentum Application Service
Documentation=https://github.com/public-daniel/Momentum
# Ensure network interfaces are fully configured before starting
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
# Type=simple is usually appropriate when the ExecStart process is the main service process.
Type=simple

# Run as the dedicated momentum user and group
User=momentum
Group=momentum

# Set working directory to the data directory. Relative paths for data/backups
# in the config (if used) would resolve relative to this path.
WorkingDirectory=/var/lib/momentum

# Command to start the application server process.
# Ensure '/opt/momentum/momentum' exists and accepts the 'run' subcommand.
ExecStart=/opt/momentum/momentum run

# Restart the service if it fails
Restart=on-failure
# Wait 5 seconds before restarting
RestartSec=5s

# Environment variables passed to the application
# Specify the path to the configuration file. Ensure your app reads this variable.
Environment="MOMENTUM_CONFIG_PATH=/etc/momentum/config.toml"
# Optional: Uncomment if your app specifically uses RUST_LOG and you want to set it here.
# Environment="RUST_LOG=info"
# Load sensitive environment variables (API keys, passwords, etc.) from this file.
EnvironmentFile=/etc/momentum/secrets.env

# === Security Hardening ===
# Prevent the service from writing to /usr, /boot, /etc
ProtectSystem=full
# Use a private /dev, restricting device access
PrivateDevices=true
# Prevent the service from gaining new privileges
NoNewPrivileges=true
# Prevent the service from accessing user home directories
ProtectHome=true
# Prevent write access to kernel tunables
ProtectKernelTunables=true
# Prevent kernel module loading/unloading
ProtectKernelModules=true
# Prevent service from interfering with control groups
ProtectControlGroups=true
# Restrict network address families (IPv4, IPv6, Unix sockets)
RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_INET AF_INET6 AF_UNIX
# Prevent memory regions from being simultaneously writable and executable
MemoryDenyWriteExecute=true
# === End Security Hardening ===

# Logging configuration
# Send standard output and standard error to the systemd journal
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
# Tag logs in the journal with 'momentum' for easier filtering (e.g., journalctl -t momentum)
SyslogIdentifier=momentum

[Install]
# Enable this service to start automatically during boot in the standard multi-user target
WantedBy=multi-user.target
